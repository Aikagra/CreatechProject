# SpiTech
SpiTech is a secret society which aims to bring together all those who are interested in helping us to reach our ultimate goal of creating new technologies and resources to fight the war we’re all facing. Just like our motto “Dive into the mystery”, we research on various ways and methods we can use to further develop our planet, to make the world a better place to live in.

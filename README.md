# SpiTech
SpiTech is a secret society which aims to bring together all those who are interested in helping us to reach our ultimate goal of creating new technologies and resources to fight the war we’re all facing. Just like our motto “Dive into the mystery”, we research on various ways and methods we can use to further develop our planet, to make the world a better place to live in.

## Features

- Login - no signup functionality has been added as this app is meant to be for the members of the society only. To become a member, users can send an email to the head of the society, who will give them a username and password to access the app with. Login credentials:
  - Email - navgarg06@gmail.com
  - Password - 123456
- Missions - There is no secret society without any missions. Our missions are targeted towards building and managing new resources and technologies, to ensure development of every being.
- Profile - The Profile page includes the details, like the name, email, phone number etc. about the logged in user
- Chat - A communication medium is a must for any society to function. The Chat fragment has a ‘CardView’ to take us to Group Chat when clicked. The Group Chat lets users chat with the admin and also with each other.

## Technologies Used

- Android Studio has been used for coding the app
- Illustrator has been used for designing the logo
- Firebase Realtime Database has been used as a backend

## Missions
### Mission 1 - Improve everyday life of humans
#### Main use: AI/ML
Use programs that will help to improve the productivity and efficiency of the planet and help to reduce repetitive actions taken up by individuals on a daily basis

#### Robots
Create robots which can perform medical operations. 

This will ensure more efficiency and productivity and can even save more lives. Better tools and technology will also help us find a cure for some diseases whose cure hasn’t been found yet. They will also ensure that the patients get their medicines at the right time as per their prescriptions based on the health parameters of the patients
Conditions in hospitals will also be improved by making it more technologically advanced.

#### Education
Repetitive tasks of the teachers to be replaced with softwares

Eg- Test paper checking, exam setup, homework checking, doubt clearing
Will be performed by AI/Ml based softwares.
In the Virtual Environment, students will be taught by mechanical teachers just like how they are taught by normal teachers. Teachers will be able to spend their time to drive innovation and quality education
With the high technology, we will be able to reach underserved students 

#### Machines
Replace human involvement in manufacturing industry by machines, integrated with AI/ML based programmes. 

Industrial IOT (Internet of Things) will help to predict the maintenance of the assets used in the manufacturing environment 

#### Services
Replace repetitive services like
- Banking
- Insurance
- Call centres

with an AI/ML based approach to reduce the number of people involved in these.

For example, banking and insurance can be managed by a BOT through online interaction with the customers and call centres can be replaced by the social media presence or online interactions.



### Mission 2 - Find new sources of green energy
#### Green Energy: 
Our main aim is to find new sources of green energy and bring them to light for the development of our planet and all its people by creation of new technologies and resources.

#### Nuclear Energy Model
Create a nuclear energy model which can power spaceships even where light from a star cannot reach it. This can be achieved by using radioactive elements and making them undergo nuclear fission.


#### Windmills
Windmills can be set up in the oceans. By using this method, we can take advantage of the offshore winds which will help to produce more energy than the usual windmills which are found on the land.

#### Geothermal Power plants
Geothermal power plants can be set up to obtain geothermal energy which is  stored and generated in the earth’s crust. Geothermal energy is useful as it is more environmentally friendly than other fuels.

#### Solar Fuels
An apparatus for solar can be created for fuels which will use sunlight to split water and co2 molecules to make hydrocarbons.

## Uniqueness and Usefulness
We believe that the SpiTech society can be a medium where everyone interested in contributing to the war can share ideas and communicate with each other. Since the planet is at war, people from different walks of life will need to contribute to the best of their potential, and being a part of a society like ours will enable them to use their abilities to the fullest, and lead humankind to victory.

## Scope and Potential
SpiTech, as we envision it, is not yet complete. Due to the limited time, some useful features were not able to be implement. Some features we would like to add:
- Some complex functionalities like an AI/ML bot to create and manage missions based on the current problems coming up during the war. 
- A forgot password option to let users change their password if they ever forget it. For now all the information about the members is present with the society head, who can be contacted in case of any issues.
